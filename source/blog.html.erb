  <h1>Finger Gym workouts and the secret to writing in the Early Years</h1>
  <h3>By Katy 27/11/2016</h3>
  <p>Children have their whole lives to perfect their writing skills; the most important thing I will note from my experience as an Early Years teacher is that we want children to <span class="bold">have fun and enjoy their early experiences with writing.</span> You don’t have to dig very deeply into writing research and statistics to see that girls are consistently out performing boys in their writing skills at both Primary and Secondary level in the UK. If a child has a negative experience with writing this really can stay with them for life, let’s try and turn this around by making sure our children are physically and emotionally prepared to write before we thrust a pencil awkwardly into their hands.</p>
  <h2>Motor Skills</h2>
  <p>Children need to develop a desire to write as well as the physical strength, dexterity and coordination required to hold a pencil and make marks. From an early age we encourage children to take part in activities that will develop their gross motor skills. Generally speaking these are the larger muscle movements such as crawling, walking, running and balancing. It is not until children have developed the muscle strength and the coordination to do these things that they can begin to develop the fine or more specific skills required to write with a pencil. For the past few years Early Years Practitioners from around the world have been doing their utmost to resist the pressure to get our children writing to make time for what should come first.</p>

  <h2>Finger Gym</h2>
  <p>I’m sure you will have heard someone say “Once you’ve learnt to ride a bike, you’ll never forget how to do it”? Although gross motor skills are vitally important, once they are acquired they can be continually improved on and are unlikely to be forgotten. Fine motor skills however need to be practised more frequently as they can be easily lost or forgotten when not used regularly. When children spend at least 5 minutes a day engaged in a fine motor activity that will challenge them and that they enjoy, we see the biggest leaps of progress.
    <br></br>In my classroom I always make sure we have planned ‘Finger Gym’ sessions and opportunities. These sessions work on different gross and fine motor skills that prepare children for writing. The activities can be as simple as moulding a piece of putty or play dough, undoing and doing up buttons, tearing up sheets of paper and scrunching them into balls or popping bubble wrap. We find it really effective when we play a song for the children; they know that although it may be repetitive they stick at the activity until the song finishes. We always explain to children why they are doing an activity and what we are working towards.</p>

    <p>Finger Gym is always progressive and can be differentiated effectively so that eventually every child has the opportunity to develop their pencil grip into a tripod grip and learn to form letters correctly.</p>

    <h2>Building Confidence and Modelling</h2>
    <p>If a child does not see the place for an activity in their world they are unlikely to try it. Making a conscious decision to write for a purpose or draw in front of your child will help to motivate them. In our technology rich world it can be tempting (and often more convenient) to write our shopping list on our phone or to email someone rather than write a letter. If they see you mark making then they are much more likely to have a go.
    <br></br>There are a couple of strategies we use as teachers to get children to have a go at writing. As silly as this sounds one of them is the mindset that ‘there is no right or wrong way to write’. Of course eventually we want all of our children to be able to form their letters correctly and spell accurately, but for now this is not important! <span class="bold">Making marks on a page and giving meaning to the marks are the key foundations for writing.</span>
    <br></br>I have a very talented colleague who shared her idea with me years ago and I continue to stand by it. Sometimes we find that children already know that there is a correct way to write and when they come to hold a pencil they stop almost in ‘writing-fright’ or fear that they will get it wrong. At this point I will show them my <span class="italics">secret writing</span>. It often resembles the reading from a richter scale or perhaps a string of lines and shapes. I tell them what it says and ask them to do their own <span class="italics">secret writing</span>. The best thing about it, is that nobody else knows what it says, it’s a secret. I encourage the children to whisper to me to tell me what it actually says. They think this is great fun and often choose to use it in their play. Only last week I spotted some excellent writing and thought to myself “Great, I’ll use that as writing evidence” to be told by the child … “This is my <span class="italics">secret writing</span> but I’m only going to tell my daddy what it says, not you.”</p>

    <p>It is truly amazing to see the change in children once they have learned a few letter sounds. They start to mix in some letter sounds around their <span class="italics">secret writing</span>. The more sounds they learn, the less they choose to secretly write and the more readable it becomes. Whatever marks a child makes I will always praise them for their efforts whether they will share the meaning with me or not!</p>
